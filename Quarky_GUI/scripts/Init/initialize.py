"""
file to create basic initialization of things used for RFSOC This will include:
- defining names for the variable attneuators
- defining yoko name
- defining the basic config dict that will state the channels used for all subsequent code

NOTE: this file is intended as a template on how to structure the initialize
file. In order to use this file, you will need to update various parameters
including the varible attenutor and yoko addresses (if you have those in your
setup, by default those are commented out here). As well the BaseConfig dict
needs to be adjusted to reflect the individual setup
